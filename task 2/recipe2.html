            <h2>Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
            <p>Spaghetti Bolognese, a classic Italian dish, features a hearty meat-based sauce served over cooked spaghetti pasta. The sauce is crafted by simmering ground meat (usually beef), aromatic vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and celery, in a rich tomato base. Flavored with herbs like basil and oregano, the sauce develops a robust, savory flavor profile. This comforting dish is a favorite worldwide, known for its satisfying combination of tender pasta and flavorful meat sauce, often topped with grated Parmesan cheese for an extra touch of indulgence.

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <h2>Step 1: Heat a large pot or pan over medium heat.</h2>
            <p>1. Add a drizzle of olive oil and sauté the chopped onion, carrots, and celery until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>2. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1-2 minutes.</p>
            <p>3. Cook the pasta until it's "al dente" (firm to the bite).</p>
            
            <h2>Step 2: Brown the Meat:</h2>
            <p>1. Push the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the ground beef.</p>
            <p>2. Break up the meat with a spoon and cook until it's no longer pink and has browned.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 3: Add Tomatoes and Flavorings:</h2>
            <p>1. Stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano, and dried basil. Cook for 2 minutes to enhance the flavors.</p>
            <p>2. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, and red wine (if using). Mix well.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Simmer the Sauce:</h2>
            <p>1. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for at least 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavors will become.</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Cook the Pasta:</h2>
            <p>1. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and add a pinch of salt.</p>
            <p>2. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente according to the package instructions.</p>
            <p>3. Drain the pasta and set aside.</p>

            <h2>Step 6: Combine Pasta and Sauce:</h2>
            <p>1. When the sauce has thickened and developed a rich flavor, season it with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
            <p>2. Combine the cooked pasta with the Bolognese sauce and toss to coat the pasta evenly.</p>

            <h2>Step 7: Serve:</h2>
            <p>1. Divide the Spaghetti Bolognese among serving plates.</p>
            <p>2. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves.</p>

            <h2>Step 8: Enjoy:</h2>
            <p>1. Serve the Spaghetti Bolognese hot and enjoy the hearty and flavorful dish!</p>
